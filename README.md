# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis.

Maria, the chief data scientist for a city school district is responsible for analyzing data from a variety of sources and formats.  In this role she is tasked with preparing all standardized test data for analysis, reporting, and preparing presentations for insight on performance trends and paths. We are helping Maria analyze data on student funding and student standardized test scores.

### Purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to aggregate the data and showcase trends on school performance.  This analysis will assist the school board and superintendent in making decisions concerning the school budgets and priorities. 

The analysis focuses on the following areas:
1. The District Summary - looks at the district overall with information on total number of students, schools, budget, and math and reading standardized test scores.
2. The School Summary - look at school type, number of students per school, school budget, math and math and reading standardized test scores.
3. The Top Five and Bottom Five performing schools based on overall passing rate.
4. The average math and reading scores by grade level for each school.
5. The math and reading scores grouped by spending range per student, school size, and school type.

### Resources
- Software:
    - Jypter Notebook 6.0.3
- Environment:
  - Python 3.7
- Dependencies:
  - Pandas Library 1.0.5
  - NumPy Library 1.17.0

## Results
The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. She has asked you to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once you’ve replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like you to repeat the school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.- How is the district summary affected?

- How is the school summary affected?
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
- Math and reading scores by grade
- Scores by school spending
- Scores by school size
- Scores by school type

## Summary: 

Summarize four major changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
